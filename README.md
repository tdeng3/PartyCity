# Server Side Rendering Frontend

Server-side rendering allows developers to pre-populate a web page with custom user data directly on the server. It is generally faster to make all the requests within a server than making extra browser-to-server round-trips for them. This is what developers used to do before client-side rendering.

# Description
This is a Server Side Rendering Frontend website for PartyCity. This application designed for creating communities. Users communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called "FunRoom."
